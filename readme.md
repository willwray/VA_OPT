### **`VA_OPT.hpp`**

C++ preprocessor utilities for testing emptiness of macro arguments  
and for expansion conditional on the emptiness of ARGS.

This is mostly a 'polyfill' library providing `__VA_OPT__`alike  functionality  
where support is not detected (so either not present or not selected).  
The utilities provided are also handy regardless of portability concerns.

<summary><code>__VA_OPT__</code> details</summary>

----

C++20 introduces a special function-like macro `__VA_OPT__`  
for use only within a variadic macro's replacement list, in which;
>IF `__VA_ARGS__` is empty  
THEN `__VA_OPT__(X...)` 'vanishes' - i.e. expands to nothing -  
ELSE it expands to `X...`

```c++
#define VARIADIC_MACRO(...) __VA_OPT__(NOT EMPTY)
VARIADIC_MACRO()  // Expands to nothing
VARIADIC_MACRO(?) // Expands to NOT EMPTY
```

</details>

Prior to C++20's `__VA_OPT__` there is no reliable test for empty ARGS.

Such 'emptiness' testing is so useful that it shouldn't be limited to C++20.  
Unfortunately, some C++20 compliant compilers hide the feature behind  
a `std=c++2a` flag and there is also no `std` feature-test for `__VA_OPT__`.

This `VA_OPT` library auto-detects preprocessor support for `__VA_OPT__`  
and, if detected, uses it as a robust way to implement:

* **`IS_EMPTY(...)`**
  * 1 if the ... ARGS is empty else 0.

* **`IFN(...)`**
  * IF `...` ARGS are not empty  
    THEN a trailing 'paren expression' `(X)` is 'deparenthesized' to `X`  
    ELSE the trailing paren expression `(X)` is consumed.

    `IFN(ARGS)` is like `__VA_OPT__` but with explicit (ARGS)  
    in place of an implicit `__VA_ARGS__` check.

* **`IFE(...)`**
  * IF `...` ARGS is empty  
    THEN expand trailing 'paren expression' `(X)` to `X`  
    ELSE consume the trailing paren expression.

* **`IFNE(...)(N,E...)`**
  * IF `...` ARGS are not empty  
    THEN expands to `N`  
    ELSE expands to `E...`

If `__VA_OPT__` support is **NOT** detected then the above macros  
are provided using a fallback method (with some failing edge cases).

## Platform note:

Current Sept 2019 `__VA_OPT__` support:

 * Clang `-std=c++2a` enables it  
(don't know how best to enable it with earlier `-std`)
 * GCC has it enabled without `-std=++2a`  
but, if an earlier `-std` flag is supplied along with `-pedantic`  
then it warns "`__VA_OPT__` is not available until C++2a"  
(don't know how to silence that without dropping `-pedantic`).
 * MSVC TBD

Props to pre-pro pioneers, particularly Paul Mensonides.

The fallback techniques are taken from BOOST libraries:

The 'emptiness' methods are adapted from BOOST_VMD_IS_EMPTY  
dependent on BOOST Preprocessor's BOOST_PP_IS_BEGIN_PARENS  
(adapted and exposed here as undocumented `IBP` 'Is Begin Parens'):
